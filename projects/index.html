            Evernote spans out its China-based unit into an independent entity with “full autonomy” over its business and services since June
            2018. We've developed some exciting new features since then, such as Sticky Note, WeChat Login, Team Space, Todo list, New
            Editor, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm in charge of  Sticky Note, WeChat Login and Team Space and I pushed the team use Swift in the project. The old code is all Objective-C. We use Swift in new functions.
